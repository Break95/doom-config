# doom-config
Doom Emacs configuration files

``` 
git clone https://github.com/Break95/doom-config ~/.doom.d
```
Doom is an active project and many of its 300+ packages are in active development as well. It is wise to occasionally update:

```
doom upgrade   # or 'doom up'
```

`doom sync`: This synchronizes your config with Doom Emacs. It ensures that needed packages are installed, orphaned packages are removed and necessary metadata correctly generated. Run this whenever you modify your `doom!` block, `init.el` or `packages.el` file.

`doom upgrade`: Updates Doom Emacs (if available) and all its packages.
